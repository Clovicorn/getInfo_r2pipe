# getInfo_r2pipe

I'm lazy....didn't want to build and import export extractor.
Since the nice developers that made Radare2 did, I'm using it.

Also built a shell script to run it.
I put mine in ~/.local/bin
edit to change directory where the python script lives.

I just add '$(pwd)/' in front of the binary file to get it's full path.

also pip install -r requirements.txt if r2pipe for python is not already installed.
